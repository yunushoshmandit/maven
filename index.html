        <h2>Tim Berners Lee bio</h2>
        <p>
            Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.

            He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up which uses, promotes and helps develop the open source Solid platform. 
            Solid aims to give people control and agency over their data, questioning many assumptions about how the web has to work. 
            Solid technically is is new level of standard at the web layer, which adds things never put into the original spec, 
            such as global single sign-on, universal access control, and a universal data API so that any app can store data in any storage place. 
            Socially Solid is a movement away from much of the issues with the current WWW, and toward a world in which users are in control, 
            and empowered by large amounts of data, private, shared, and public.
